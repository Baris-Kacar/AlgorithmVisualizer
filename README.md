#Algorithm Visualizer#
##Description##
The Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based application that allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. This project aims to provide a visual representation of how different algorithms explore and find the shortest path between two points on a grid.

##Features##
Graph Manipulation: Users can interact with the grid by selecting start and target nodes, adding walls, and deleting walls to create a custom graph for algorithm visualization.
Pathfinding Algorithms: The application supports popular pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search algorithm.
Real-Time Visualization: Users can observe how the chosen algorithm explores the graph, marking expanded nodes and the shortest path in real time.
Color-coded Nodes: The nodes on the grid are color-coded to represent different states, such as start node, target node, walls, expanded nodes, and the shortest path.

##Technologies Used##
The Algorithm Visualizer is built using the following technologies:

* HTML, Tailwind, and JavaScript for the frontend user interface.
* Canvas API for rendering the grid and visualizing the algorithm.

##Getting Started##
To get started with the Algorithm Visualizer, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/dilsoziya/AlgorithmVisualizer.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd AlgorithmVisualizer
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

##Usage##
Choose the desired graph size and configuration options.
Select the start node and the target node on the grid.
Customize the walls by adding or deleting them.
Select the desired pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Visualize" button to start the visualization.
Observe the algorithm in action, with nodes being expanded and the shortest path being highlighted.
Use the step-by-step execution feature to understand the algorithm's progress in detail.
Reset the graph or walls as needed using the corresponding buttons.
Experiment with different algorithms, graph configurations, and settings to gain insights into pathfinding algorithms.
